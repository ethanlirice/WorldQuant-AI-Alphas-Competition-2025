/*Idea 
In financial analysis, a company's leverage, represented by its liability-to-asset ratio, is a key indicator of its financial risk. Higher leverage, while often seen as a risk, indicates that the company has borrowed money to finance its operations and growth. However debt or liabilities is also considered a cheaper form of capital compared to equity financing, thus higher liabilities may potentially boost future profitability.
  
Hypothesis 
Comparatively higher liabilities may indicate that the company has higher leverage and may have higher returns in the future.
  
Implementation 
Compare liabilities among companies.

Expression
liabilities

What’s next?
Different companies have different scale of assets. Can performing a ratio analysis comparison by normalizing the liability with company assets improve Alpha performance?
